# RHCSA (EX200) 9 Prep Repo
This repo contains my study notes, a practice task list I used for preparing for the RHCSA 9 exam, as well as some general guidelines for how I built out my lab.

## Layout
The site is broken into three main areas:
- Study Notes
- Exam Prep

## Study Notes
This is a collection of my notes that I took while preparing. It is fairly disorganized at the moment, but there is a lot of good material in there.


## Exam Prep
This area has my practice task list, as well as a solution guide to the practice task list. Don't look at this as a "practice test", as the list of tasks here is considerably longer than what is required for the RHCSA exam. The task list is designed to cover every exam objective for the RHCSA 9 exam.
